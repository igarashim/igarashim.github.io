### bicycle
<img src="bianchi.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="500px">
<p>I go to school by riding raod bike, [IMPULSO](https://www.cycleurope.co.jp/2012/bikes/road/c2c/impulso_alu_105_10sp_compact.html)(2012 model) made by Bianchi. </p>

<p>But I recently get tired to ride for even 30 minutes to go to school, I guess it's because of age... So I want to buy own car, and drive to somewhere far away on holiday.</p>

### coffee
<p>I love coffee, and a cup of coffee makes me calm down.<br>
In Sendai, there are many coffee shops, where is good taste, relaxed atmosphere, or playing nice music.<br>
Here I introduce some shops around Sendai station.</p>
<p>
* **as time**: in the Clisroad, featuring quiet atmosphere and strong coffee
* **?????? (dougenzaka)**: mysterious shop that there are many old comics and small articles 
* **?ۑ????? (custom)**: I love drinking coffee while watching trees of Jozenji street at window seat
* **corner house**: flower shop and coffee shop and bar, playing AOR musics
* **?g?L?V???Y(tokishirazu)**: bar offering good coffee, playing bossa nova
* **?ҁ[?Ղ? (people)**: offering so large spaghetti, I like here's neapolitan
* **cafe mozart Atelier**: I recommend terrace seats with Hirese river view
* **?܂ߖV (mamebou)**: many cups are displayed, and we can drink by own selecting cup 
* **teato**: tea and alcohol and sometimes coffee, lunch menu is also nice
* **?Ԃ?????(akai yane)**: let's have fun flower's smell as garnish to coffee

### music
I like listening to and playing music, here are my favorite artists and their genre of music. To be honest, I think classifying musics or artists by genre is nonsense, but it's easy to see rather than disorder. 
```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(knitr))
music = c("AOR","SSW","POP","alternative","indie rock","post rock","ROCK","electronic","hiphop")
artist = c(
